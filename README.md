## A simple sheet music player ( for program learning )

using Win32 midi api, play a kind of score .

### dependence

- A C++ compiler, such as `g++`, `clang++`, `msvc`

- win32 midi lib: `winmm`

- `fmtlib`

### bulid

I use win32 api, so only windows is support.

if you use MSYS/MSYS2/Cygwin or any other subsystem that can use bash, <br>
you can just use `make` to build the executable file.

### directory & files

`/src` the source

`/include` include files dir

`/demo` the demo scores, you can also learn score rules there.

### others

using makefile.

this lib is aimed to learn, the target is written in `/TODO`.

if you have better ideas, thanks for your issues.
